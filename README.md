# OSDEV group

The idea of this project is concentrate tools, documentations, design
ideas, essays, discussions and so on, related to operating system
development.

*Every contribution must be reviewed*

I know several fellas interested in developing toy/research operating
systems, hack some existing kernel, write device drivers or simply
learn low level things. With this project we can reuse each other
tool, ask if someone already tried some crazy idea, request a code
review, start a collaborative project, and so on.

At least, we'll learn and stay in touch!

## Project structure

  * Compilers.md
  * BIOS.md

  * DOS.md
  * VGA.md
  * Testing.md
  * APIC.md
  * SMP.md
  * drivers.md
  * and so on
- bootloaders: Good bootloaders to study;
- skel: Operating system skeletons for starters;
- tools: Curated list of tools
  * disk utilities
